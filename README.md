# Jax-Kal Companion App

The game “Project Jax” is a multiplayer side scrolling platformer which we are building on a C++ 3D rendering engine with a 2D point of view. There is a wide story behind this platformer. We are creating a companion app for Project Jax which will be a comic book app of the game. After creating the app, we are planning to release 1 page every week.

The networking components are as follows;
Number of players: Version1 -> 2 Players, Version2-> 4 players.
Players we cooperate to achieve the goal of the level. If a player chooses single player, then that player can switch between characters anytime. If the player wants so switch between characters while in a multiplayer game, it sends a request to the other client. If he/she accepts, they switch characters with all the statuses that the characters have.All position, status and animations will be replicated to other client as well as environmental effects like position and stateof the enemies and pickup-able objects.

As mentioned before, this companion app is about being a comic book app, (if anyone can download this app or read our story for free then we will implement the advertisement to our app) and we will be making the users watch the advertisements since it would be the main source for server. While the users are using the app, every chapter will have a whole page of an advertisement pops up, and the user can continue just by simply (keeping scrolling down/press the "Next page" button). Although it is the source for the server, we will not abuse it since the users do not want to see the advertisements all the time so we will try to keep them limited (or less than 3 pages of them).

(The Jax-Kal Companion App is an app where users can enjoy reading our stories from our game through visuals. The stories include in the main story of the game and the side stories such as about the side characters, another character's perspective during the main story happens, what happens before and after the main story. We will also provide the function that saves where the users last so they can continue when they turn the app back on.)



Purpose: 
The purpose of the Jax-Kal Companion App is for users to enjoy reading our game’s story through drawings. The app will be released after the game’s release.

Areas of Interest:

Analytics: We want to know which audience is using our app such as their age, region, and country, at the same time we also want to know which page they stay on the most, how many views for a chapter in overall, the rating for each chapter. The way we do this is to make our users become a member of the app. We will create our own registration page or the users can use their Facebook accounts to log in to our app.

Ads Support: We will add the advertisements in our code, and design a specific area that is just for the advertisement and the platform of the advertisement is Google.

Example Screens:

Check out “Design Idea.png” section on Github.

Values of the App:

As mentioned, the app’s purpose is for the users to enjoy reading our game’s story under our drawings and it is totally free. This means that people have or have not played our game before but just want to read just the story without playing through the game.

Typical path through out the app:

When the user logins in, they will enter the home page, they can then select the story they want to read. In there, they can select the chapter, or if they have read before, they can continue to read the chapter they were reading before by clicking the bottom right button (the button displays the chapter where they left off). 

One comic page is displayed in each page, so to continue reading the next page, they can click the “Next” button, otherwise, they can click “Prev” button to go back one page.

Use Cases:
Mentioned in “Typical path through out the app” section.

# Jax-Kal Companion App

The game “Project Jax” is a multiplayer side scrolling platformer which we are building on a C++ 3D rendering engine with a 2D point of view. There is a wide story behind this platformer. We are creating a companion app for Project Jax which will be a comic book app of the game. After creating the app, we are planning to release 1 page every week.

The networking components are as follows;
Number of players: Version1 -> 2 Players, Version2-> 4 players.
Players we cooperate to achieve the goal of the level. If a player chooses single player, then that player can switch between characters anytime. If the player wants so switch between characters while in a multiplayer game, it sends a request to the other client. If he/she accepts, they switch characters with all the statuses that the characters have.All position, status and animations will be replicated to other client as well as environmental effects like position and stateof the enemies and pickup-able objects.

As mentioned before, this companion app is about being a comic book app, (if anyone can download this app or read our story for free then we will implement the advertisement to our app) and we will be making the users watch the advertisements since it would be the main source for server. While the users are using the app, every chapter will have a whole page of an advertisement pops up, and the user can continue just by simply (keeping scrolling down/press the "Next page" button). Although it is the source for the server, we will not abuse it since the users do not want to see the advertisements all the time so we will try to keep them limited (or less than 3 pages of them).

(The Jax-Kal Companion App is an app where users can enjoy reading our stories from our game through visuals. The stories include in the main story of the game and the side stories such as about the side characters, another character's perspective during the main story happens, what happens before and after the main story. We will also provide the function that saves where the users last so they can continue when they turn the app back on.)
